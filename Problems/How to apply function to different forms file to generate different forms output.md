When doing experiment in lab, I got fixed all this `.csv` file's error example. Fixing means using base or other methods to recalculate the points in error examples and replace the original example to another new file with the same formation.

Now I got 36 files at least, and each may have different file formations, each are matched with a specific `fixed.py` file, driving me crazy.
