## 1 Common Mistakes shared by founders
> You need an amazing idea to get started.

Obviously, everybody gotta little something, something. Some fascinating while others boring. However, it is not the startup's necessity.
> Opposite to the upper one: jump in the first idea without any critical thinking.

> SISP, Solution in search of Problem.

Yeah, the research that I dive into for my first time is tracked by this mistakes.
We are trying to introduce the **Syllogism** method to address the ==TUI LI== problem and improves the performance of LLMs. We seems to have a problem of low performance on ==TUI LI==, but actually it is too abstract, what we are doing is just to apply a new method to a problem that seems to be a real problem.
> Startup ideas are hard to find. You just don't know how to catch them. Once you learn how to notice them, you'll see them **all over the place**.

I can't wait. That's why the repo exists!
# 2 Standard of idea
left...When I got just one idea.

> Some criterion about ideas:
> 1. How big is the market? Or the market is booming fast like cryptocurrency?
> 2. Founder-Market Fit, which means are you the right person or even the only person who could do it well?
> 3. **How sure** are you that you're solving a **big problem**? Ideally, you'd experienced the problem.
> 4. Are you making things that **you personally want**?
> 5. If something newly **recently became possible**, it is a chance for you to build things on top of that.

> Some **FILTERS** about ideas:
> 1. The idea seems hard to start.
> 2. The idea seems boring.
> 3. The idea seems too ambitious.
> 4. There exist competitors.

Yeah, I haven't any concrete ideas that could been landed into business, and i wrote down the sentence in the beginning:
> *"left...When I got just one idea."*

That's totally wrong. The best way to generate a **good idea** is to wait it bumping into your life organically. And the only way you can do is to know *What is a good idea and what is a bad one* and just wait, since you are not that hurry, right?

# 3 Four Filters of Good Ideas
> 1. The idea seems hard to get started -- schlep blindness
> 2. Ideas in boring space.
> 3. Ideas seem too ambitious, which most of founders instinctually shy away.
> 4. Ideas with competitors. When you noticed something that others do not, you win.

# 4 How to have ideas organically
> Know exactly how a **Good Ideas** look like.

Well, that's my fault. Before i read to this line, i just ignore the former part of *How a good idea looks like*, cuz i'm thinking that i have no any ideas now, i don't need this stuff.
Actually, it counts. If you do not know what is good idea, then you would never know what is a idea.
> Standing in the forefront of **ANY** area.

For me, the closest one is AI, which I'm just digging into.
> Working for a startup.

- [x] Ask Tianming to see if there are any chances that i could do something.
# 5 Seven recipe to generate idea, from best to worst
> 1. Start with the things that your team are unfairly outweighing others.
> 	1. Look through all your experience
> 	2. What are the things that you learn and others do not even know?

## N: How to come up with an idea?
> Organically idea is always the better. Just play a **Long Game** to find them.
> Or some subjective way: 
> 1. Become an expertise in something valuable.
> 2. Work at a startup.
> 3. Build things that you find interesting.

As for the second point, I just had an opportunity for this summer vacation.
