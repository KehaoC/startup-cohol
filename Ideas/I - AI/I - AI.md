Our intention is to build the "operation system of AI era", which could be regarded the microsoft in PC era.
So how to define a operation system? Based on the hardware device, the operation system are the leading role guy who fully utilize the power of hardwares. Without the connection of OS, hardwares are just a piece of useless stone. And thousands of concrete applications with diverse usage were built on a specific OS that could run normally in different device but the only OS.
We can imagine OS as a tunnel that connect both the hardware and software sides. A keypoint is that both side of hardware and software are what is essential for costmers, while to use this stuff.
Below we can extract some key of OS:
- [ ] Built on hardware, which can utilize the full capability of different hardware.
- [ ] Providing a structure or a platform for developers to build diverse application for users.
- [ ] Users have no choice but to equip the device with OS to run applications.
- [ ] Once used, can never leave without.

==The best answer is a more human like agents' leader.==
**How to interact with this stuff? 
It's basically like `siri` as we all known. You can just call her like exactly siri or other form that we are still considering better than it.**

**Then, what's the difference with `siri`?**
I-AI was a more humanized `siri` with the key to all AI-product or non-AI-product that only designed for you and owned by you. She is own your Javice. 

Or, it is like an AI-Wechat(AI-what's up). Or like a dialing content that you needs to input the number of the `siri` to make contact with her.

She will be your own designed partner in everyday work and live.
**Firstly, you will love her** for her voice and tone that are so facinating that you can not turn down. Under the basic phenomenon of her performance, her value are more compatible with yours, so you'll definitly feel comfortable interact with her. What's more, she will grow with you.

**Secondly, you will regard her as your virtual house keeper.** Whenever you got in trouble, she will provide with you an both logic and mental confortable method to solve this problem. She could always be here for you and provide you a better solution. Concretely, she knows everything about the AI or non-AI product or agents that are overwhelming in this era, and knows your needs. So she could suggest the one that most fits your needs and provide you a guidence when you driving this stuff.

This are the basic usage.
You can also ask him to make contact with a guy that she knows who could solve your problem, and keep it to your album for you to contact further. And maybe you can also ask her to do some extremely basic and easy stuff to directly make some helps in daily acitivity that are not so easy to make errors.

We encourage  users to make contact with I-AI through totally voice like calling a true guy. So she will be equipped with a more humanlize voice and tune. And she will have her own stuff to do, so may not catch you (actually out of using limitations). 

Our final goal is `let i-AI interact for you with all the virtual world, while you just need a simple call and drink a bottle of coffee.`

**Why she is the solution to the OS in AI era?**
 - [x] Built on hardware, which can utilize the full capability of different hardware.
 The hardware of this era is compute units. While we are using ChatGPT or gemini, we are using GPU from time to time to get our answer. But actually, what you could use are not that small range of GPU unit, but a world wide. For their are so many AI-product that are out of your recognition zone. 
 *What you don't know is what you don't notice, while what you don't notice is not existing in your world.*
 So, I-AI provide you a way for you to know every compute unit under the product mask that for you to utilize, which also highly satisfied your needs.
Ultimately, we could draw a conclusion of that, I-AI was built on hardware and can utilize the full capability of different hardware.
- [ ] Providing a structure or a platform for developers to build diverse application for users.
In user view, they can simply ask I-AI to call out a helper which highly satisfy their specific needs. If not temporarily exist, I-AI will create one without your ask. What you need to do is just to drink a bottle of coffee. However, this process should be limited to simple solution in some simple problem.

For more difficult solution, we are here connecting all the excelent AI-product or non-AI-product company to make a connection with i-AI. And for not so difficult task, users could just follow the instructions or just easy chat with I-AI to solve. Further, I-AI leads you to their products and hidden background whenever you encounter some difficults, you can ask for help, I-AI is the `help handbook` for every product it provide.

So, we are providing a platform for developers to build diverse application for users, which need only have a api with our product then improve their products.
- [ ] Users have no choice but to equip the device with OS to run applications.
Once you have us, you have the whole AI world. If you do not have us, you are just like swimming in Pacific Ocean of products without targets. And we provide a more humanlize and nature way for you to interact with all products in a as short as of time, boosting your efficiency.

Besides, for some basic and easy situation to use this product, you never need to click in the web or app, we are all in one for you. 
So, users have no choice but to equip the device with us for seeking a key to AI-world.
- [ ] Once used, can never leave without.
Good product will tell.
What we built is a personal designed version, like a wechat. It is nearly impossible for you to create another wechat, right?
So once used, can never leave without.

**Are this a good idea?**
From Y-Conbinator standard:
1. How big is the market? Or the market is booming fast like cryptocurrency?
All people, booming.
2. Founder-Market Fit, which means are you the right person or even the only person who could do it well? ==Team competency==
We are all students team. I'm tech guy and longing for using fancy products in virtual world, like i love to dead the editor of `vim`. And iceice are a guy with infinite moods and emotions, and *how to better be accessed into this AI-world* is a daily question that we encounter. She is a master I have never seen before in ==sharing emotions==, which have a decisive value in making a product.
3. **How sure** are you that you're solving a **big problem**? Ideally, you'd experienced the problem.
We are experienced the problem. That's a big problem, we want to let all people with a simple phone to get in the fantasy world of AI.
4. Are you making things that **you personally want**?
Yeah!!!
5. If something newly **recently became possible**, it is a chance for you to build things on top of that.
Thousands of AI-product...

MVP:
- [ ] A page that we can call I-AI, which is more like calling a friend when you dialing the number of her. Respectively, she will call you when she is missing you.
- [ ] An interesting, I-AI with memory. Basically, we can run our basic model in any device and then change its tone to make it more interesting. Besides, we transform the text to any voice that you could design just for you in instance. To stress, I-AI has her own grown-up experience and her own feeling or values toward different view that are more radical but it is directly based on the users if they want.
- [ ] Basic function like suggesting what to do and so on.
- [ ] Our design are for users dopamine and endorphin. Like tik-tok stuff who utilize the function and weakness of humanity. We will occupy every users' mind by analysis people's true needs and satisfy it in a way that nobody in the world can do but in a limited way.

# Final version of pitching deck
Hey everyone, I’m cohol Cai from mainland China. I’m thrilled to have the chance to be part of IDEATION’s shortlist and share our insights on the future of AI with all of you.

In three minutes, I’ll show you the core of our fantastic idea.

- Core value
Since GPT’s release in December 2022, we’ve entered the AI era, similar to how Apple launched the personal computer age with the first Mac in 1984.

In the end, it wasn’t the many hardware or software companies that dominated the tech world, but Microsoft, which became the essential bridge with its Windows operating system, making everyone rely on it.

Our goal is to be the AI era’s operating system.

- What are we
In a word.
We are making a product that allows you to inject a unique AI soul into any AI product, creating a seamless, personalized experience where your AI, with its own personality, memories, and experiences, becomes the core of your journey through the virtual world. 

Let's forging the soul of Tomorrow's AI.

- Why we become the OS

OS companies dominate the market for three big reasons:

1.	Their operating systems unlock the full power of hardware, making everything click. Without an OS, hardware’s just a paperweight, and software’s like stars you can’t reach.
2.	Once people get the hang of an OS, they’re hooked for life. The loyalty is off the charts.
3.	You need a specific OS to run different software, and it’s usually pre-installed, making it a no-brainer.

Now, here’s how our AI shakes things up in the AI era:

1.	In this new age, we’ve got hardware (GPUs) and software (AI agents and products). Unlike the PC era, where the OS was the middleman, today’s users interact with GPUs through AI products—but there’s no middle layer OS. Our solution? A lifelike AI with memory, personality, and its own voice. Each user gets a personal AI tied to a unique key, bringing any AI product to life. This key allows users to fully tap into GPUs, interacting seamlessly with various AI products through our interface.
2.	Our AI is super customizable, ensuring that once users start, they’re hooked—kind of like how you wouldn’t want to use someone else’s TikTok feed.
3.	To use various AI software, our product is the essential link. It connects all AI products, offering a unified and personalized experience that can’t be matched otherwise.

- Why we ireplacable

1.	Big companies can’t roll out super customized AI products because if they slip up, the whole company takes a hit, not just the AI division. But us? We’re just getting started, so we can experiment on a smaller scale and fine-tune our product until it’s rock solid.
2.	Creating a general AI is no walk in the park. It’s gotta communicate with future AI big shots and existing powerhouses, which eats up a lot of time. And time? Well, that’s money.

- How we land

Step One:

Quickly develop a tech solution that creates an AI with human-like experiences, values, and a unique language style. This AI should be versatile enough to integrate with various AI products, acting as an independent layer on top of existing models.

Step Two:

Hit the market from both ends. First, get initial users on board to refine our AI’s human experience. Second, reach out to major AI product companies, inviting them to open their API interfaces to us. Our aim? To inject soul into their AIs.

Both ends support each other. Consumers (C-end) will use our product for future compatibility with various AI products. Businesses (B-end) will open their interfaces to us to attract more users to their products.

Step Three:

Launch our first marketing campaign, leveraging the groundwork from steps one and two.

Step Four:

Introduce a new feature: AI-product recommendation. Once we have several AI products integrated with our soul interface, we’ll develop a function where users only need to call our AI. Our AI will then inject itself into the appropriate AI product, seamlessly transitioning to assist the user. This will speed up the user-AI company flywheel. At the same time, we’ll enhance the product experience.

Step Five:

Further optimize for more personalized content to boost user retention. Our goal is to not lose a single user who tries our product.

- Why we?
Our team’s young and wild, brimming with imagination and fearlessness—especially in tech. Our insights are one-of-a-kind. I’ve got a top-tier computer science background from a major Chinese university, with ties to top labs like the HPC Lab and Tianhe-2. I’ve led countless student organizations too. My partner? She’s got an unparalleled emotional intelligence, picking up on things most miss—just what AI lacks. The market needs young blood like us. We’re from one of South China’s best research universities, backed by a century of alumni. We’re the perfect fit for this market and product.

Thank you!
